Stock Prediction Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting stock prices using historical data. The code demonstrates a complete workflow from data collection to model deployment.

Features
Data Collection: Fetches historical stock price data from APIs.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares data, including normalization and feature engineering.
Model Training: Implements various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM.
Evaluation: Assesses model performance with metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
Prediction: Generates future stock price predictions.
Visualization: Provides visualizations to compare predicted vs. actual stock prices
